- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonny Frodsham, JavaScript Engineer with over 20 years of experience.
- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript, React, Remix.run and Node.
- 🌱 I’m currently working in Remix.run and having some fun with Web3 and Solidity.
- Most of my work is under NDA so this account has public repos containing code experiments for fun and proof of concepts.
