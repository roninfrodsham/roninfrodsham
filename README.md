- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonny Frodsham, Technical Lead and JavaScript Engineer.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in JavaScript, React, Remix.run and sometimes Node.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working in Remix.run and having some fun with Web3 and Solidity.
- Most of my work is under NDA so this repo is public and contains experiments and testing.
